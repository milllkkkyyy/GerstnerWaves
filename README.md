# GerstnerWaves

## GOALS

To learn how to implement boat physics and play with 3D water shaders.

## TECHNIQUES

I used a shader to create the visual waves, and then replicated the wave equations in GDSCRIPT for physics calculations.

## WARNING

I did not code the fragment part of the shader. I am still learning how to do that.
